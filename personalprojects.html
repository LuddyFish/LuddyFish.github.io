                    <p class="description">
                        A major Uni assignment piece. This game is a 2D action-fighting platformer where
                        you weave spells together to destroy as many enemies as possible. The focus was 
                        on developing powerful spells that feel awesome to wield, all of which are distinct 
                        and have a unique feel to them.

                        This was an exam game in which we had 2 weeks to build a specified game like as if 
                        it were a game jam. We were required to build up to 10 levels and complete as much 
                        of the specifications as possible in the given time.

                        A simple dumb yet stupidly fun clicker game where you have to click the "correct"
                        button as much as possible, with the game growing harder and harder over time.
